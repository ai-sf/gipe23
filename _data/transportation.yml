The bus leaves at least once an hour and runs between the airport and Piazza Aldo Moro square near the main railway station Bari Centrale. Travel time is about 50 minutes, as the bus has to make multiple stops. A one-way ticket costs € 1.20, a day ticket is available for € 2.50 per person. You can buy tickets from the bus driver and with your mobile phone via SMS. The last bus from the airport departs around 22:00 hours, check the time schedule for more details."
      - text: "A train line is available, which has a connection at the airport and can take you to the main train station in the city centre, Bari Centrale. This line is called the FM2 line (or FR2 line) and it is operated by the Bari metropolitan railway service - Ferrotramviaria S.P.A. The station is not that close to the airport, so you must add at least 10 minutes to your journey time to walk to the platform; however, it is well signposted from the terminal and it will take you through a series of tunnels. There are 41 trains operating on weekdays and 33 trains operating on weekends, which depart the airport between 05:26 and 23:38 at intervals between 20 and 30 minutes. A journey from the airport to Bari Centrale will take 17 minutes and stop at 5 stations along the way. A journey from the airport to the central station or vice versa will cost €5.00 per person for a one-way ticket."
